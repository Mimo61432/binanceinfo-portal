INVESTMENT INFORMATION DOCUMENT

BTC REFERRAL INVESTMENT Participation Program
Merchant: Aniket Paul
Effective Date: 28 August 2025



1. Program Overview

This document provides detailed information regarding participation in a BTC-focused REFERRAL INVESTMENT digital asset strategy facilitated through Binance.

The purpose of this program is to provide structured participation in Bitcoin (BTC)–based yield opportunities available within the Binance ecosystem. Allocations are deployed into BTC-oriented instruments and structured yield opportunities as available during the active investment cycle.

At the present stage, the primary focus of allocation is:
	•	Bitcoin (BTC)
	•	BTC-related yield mechanisms within Binance

No alternative asset exposure is planned unless formally communicated.


2. Role of the Facilitator

Aniket Paul acts as a Merchant and Facilitator coordinating participation into Binance-based REFERRAL INVESTMENT digital asset opportunities.

The Facilitator:
	•	Assists in structuring the allocation cycle
	•	Oversees deployment timing
	•	Does not coordinates settlement upon maturity
	•	Provides cycle updates where applicable

All allocations are executed within the Binance trading and investment infrastructure.


3. Investment Allocation Limits

To maintain structured allocation and liquidity discipline:
	•	Maximum allocation per individual: 500 USDT
	•	No allocation exceeding this threshold will be accepted under this program.

This cap ensures balanced exposure and controlled capital flow within each cycle.


4. Investment Cycle & Duration

The program operates on a performance-cycle model.
	•	The active trading duration is structured around a 21-day performance cycle.
	•	The maturity date is not finalised.
	•	Settlement timing remains flexible until performance targets are achieved within the structured cycle.

Because REFERRAL INVESTMENT digital asset strategies are market-dependent, the exact settlement date is determined based on performance completion rather than a rigid calendar deadline.

The cycle formally begins on 28 August 2025.



5. Performance Framework

The program is structured with defined performance brackets:
	•	Minimum expected multiplier: 2.44x of allocated capital
	•	Maximum expected multiplier: 2.45x of allocated capital

Performance realization depends on BTC yield execution during the active cycle.

Settlement is processed once the applicable multiplier target within this framework has been achieved and finalized for the cycle.


6. Settlement & Distribution

Upon completion of the investment cycle:
	•	Allocated capital and applicable performance multiplier are calculated.
	•	Distribution is executed in USDT.
	•	Settlement timing is coordinated after maturity confirmation.

All payouts are processed following internal reconciliation and confirmation of cycle completion.


7. Market Conditions & Execution Environment

This program operates within the Binance digital asset ecosystem, utilizing BTC-based REFERRAL INVESTMENT opportunities available during the allocation period.

Execution depends on:
	•	Market liquidity
	•	BTC volatility structure
	•	Availability of yield instruments within Binance at the time of deployment

Allocation remains dynamic within BTC-focused instruments throughout the active cycle.


8. Participation Confirmation

By participating in this program, the individual confirms:
	•	Voluntary allocation of capital
	•	Understanding of the structured cycle format
	•	Acceptance of the performance-based maturity structure
	•	Agreement to the maximum allocation limit of 500 USDT

This document serves as formal informational disclosure of the operational structure of the BTC REFERRAL INVESTMENT Participation Program.
